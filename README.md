# Text Generator

This project is a **Text Generator** built using Python and designed to generate predictive text. The core model leverages machine learning techniques (likely LSTM or a similar approach) to predict the next word in a sentence based on previous context.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of training and evaluating a text generation model. The model has been trained on a dataset of text, and it aims to predict the next word in a sequence.

### Key Features:
- **Text Sequence Prediction**: Predicts the next word based on the context of previous words.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The main code implementation is provided in the Jupyter Notebook format, making it easy to run and modify.
- **GPU Acceleration**: The notebook is designed to leverage GPU acceleration for faster model training and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-generator.git
   cd text-generator
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Text_Generator.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and test the model.

## Model Architecture

The model uses a neural network architecture, likely an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, which is well-suited for sequential data like text. The architecture can be customized to improve accuracy and performance.

## Dataset

The notebook uses a text dataset for training, and you can provide your own dataset by following the instructions within the notebook.

## Results

The notebook provides visualizations of model accuracy and loss during training. Additionally, it showcases the text generated by the model based on various input sequences.

## Future Improvements

- Enhancing the model architecture for better accuracy.
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse text sources.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimized performance.
